As a Full-Stack Developer, I've had the opportunity to work with many different technologies. Here's an overview of my current tech stack and why I love using these tools.

## Frontend Development

### React & Next.js

React has been my go-to library for building user interfaces. Combined with **Next.js**, I can create:

- Server-side rendered applications
- Static sites with excellent SEO
- API routes for backend functionality
- Optimized images and fonts

```tsx
// Example Next.js App Router page
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <main className="container mx-auto p-4">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">Welcome!</h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

### Vue.js & Nuxt.js

I also work extensively with **Vue.js** and **Nuxt.js**. Vue's reactivity system and single-file components make it a joy to work with:

```vue
<template>
  <div class="card">
    <h2>{{ title }}</h2>
    <p>{{ description }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
defineProps<{
  title: string;
  description: string;
}>();
</script>
```

## Backend Development

### Laravel

**Laravel** is my framework of choice for PHP backend development. Its elegant syntax and powerful features make building APIs a breeze:

- Eloquent ORM for database operations
- Built-in authentication and authorization
- Queue management for background jobs
- Excellent documentation

### Python & .NET

For more specialized tasks, I also work with:

- **Python** for data processing and automation
- **.NET** for enterprise applications

## Database

| Database | Use Case |
| -------- | -------- |
| PostgreSQL | Production applications, complex queries |
| MySQL | WordPress sites, Laravel projects |

## Styling

### TailwindCSS

TailwindCSS has revolutionized how I style applications. The utility-first approach allows for rapid development:

```html
<button class="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-600 transition-colors">
  Click me
</button>
```

## DevOps & Tools

- **Git** for version control
- **VS Code** as my primary editor
- **Linux** for development environment
- **Docker** for containerization

## Conclusion

The web development landscape is constantly evolving, and I'm always learning new technologies. Currently, I'm diving deeper into:

- TypeScript for better type safety
- Server Components in Next.js
- Edge computing and serverless functions
